## Data description

\[MELINA: describe the data and how it was collected here (basically the first part of your methods)\]

## Data Import and Cleaning

First we import all carbon and nitrogen content data from leaves pre- and post-drought.

```{r}
rawdata <- read.csv("N_C_Data.csv", header = T)
```

Here below we go through several data cleaning steps.

```{r}
# use dplyr to "select" only the columns we need (ID, c and n weight percent)
library(dplyr)
selected_data <- rawdata %>%
  select(Samp_ID, ends_with("_p"))

# To view data, run: view(selected_data)

# use dplyr to "filter" out (remove) non-costus data rows (e.g. Bypass)
# not filtering out everything - need to remove all Apple* Oregano* capsule*
#filtered_data <- selected_data %>%
#  filter(!(Samp_ID %in% c("Atropine", "Bypass", "Blank","Apple leaf")))
# above code doesn't remove all extra data, leaves 731 obs. 

# try filtering to only include those with *GREEN* *DRY* *DEAD*
# Eliminate everything BUT samples with *ALLE* and *VILL*
# Try converting DRY to DEAD (or visa versa)
# Split the Sample ID column so we have a true sample ID column and a separate green_dry column

## later: 
# Try using reshape from dplyr to get all data from one sample onto one row
# Create a new column with 'mutate' from 'dplyr' that applies the senescence eqation to the leaf N data

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
